I have been watching these birds since 1993. Three different nest locations have been used including their current location since they first nested here in 1991.  Many amazing feats of flying have been observed here by 1000's of people. Bald Eagles have been chased away and once a Turkey Vulture was chased in a full dive down the face of the Precipice, where the female Peregrin landed on the TV's back and plucked out a feather.....which floated to the ground 150 feet away. --  In 1993 when I launched Down East Birdwatching and Nature Tours , I would spend hours watching and observing Peregrine Falcon,  a new species reintroduced into the world after decades of ignorance lead to their extirpation in 1963. In 1993,  People from around the world coming to Acadia National Park  would stop and talk to me about Peregrine life histories and the current amazing fact that these birds are returning to this cliff face to  raise young predators.  Here I am again this morning, after 24 years,  showing a young man and his mother  a bird species that was almost decimated by ecological ignorance, perpetuated by the money grabbers and the politically blind.  The second year I was out there, Acadia National Park began to send park rangers to the parking lot and so,  we all began talking about DDT and pesticides, raptors, fragile eggs and on and on.  From those early days  until today  there is an on-going Peregrine education program almost everyday............... and about 80 chicks later and 24 years.... I am once again here looking at Peregrines in a nest.    Thank you to everyone who worked on this project. Let's all be so thoughtful about the future.","",-68.1878144,44.3494526,"state endangered"

I had seen them together diving and playing with each other the day before. These are the recently fledged Precipice birds. This eastern side of MDI has tall Pinus strobus and rock cliffs which are perfect places to hunt for food and protect the immature birds. It is because of the rugged outcroppings along this eastern coast of MDI that our Peregrine 's are doing so well. As we tried to walk down the trail to the van the adult female came toward us very aggressively and trapped us momentarily on the trail with an aggressive behavior I have not seen before for this species. Her aggressive approach and loud scolding was more Goshawk-like. When the adult started calling all 3 immature birds flew into a large White Pine which we passed by earlier and then initially found the birds. The trail is really the only way back to our van so we were stuck. At one point the adult bird flew close enough that we were forced to take cover behind a partial blow-down.  We waited in amazementbehind that tree for about 15 minutes when the female abruptly departed, I suspect, having assessed that we were not a threat. The photo of the immature Peregrine was taken during our first close encounter when we first arrived",-68.183341,44.3635933,"state endangered"

First noticed an unusual number of Common Ravens circling above Great Cranberry Island, and zoomed in to high power on the scope. Raven behavior caught my attention, in that they were circling above the trees and not flying directionally; reminiscent of how Herring Gulls all fly up in the presence of a Bald Eagle. As I scanned the CORA group, one bird emerged from the individuals that was a Peregrine Falcon. It was soaring amongst the Ravens and periodically stooped with rapid wingbeats on one individual, which was flying to evade the strike. Sort of a slow-motion dog fight. At one point the PEFA was underneath that same Raven and turned upside down, flipped back upright and evaded the raven. Mostly it was the falcon in pursuit of one apparent target individual. Observation lasted a total 3 - 4 minutes before the birds moved past the visible tree line. Fascinating and exciting.",-68.3025,44.2373,"state endangered"
